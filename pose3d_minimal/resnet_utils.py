"""Contains building blocks for various versions of Residual Networks.

Residual networks (ResNets) were proposed in:
  Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
  Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. arXiv:1512.03385, 2015

More variants were introduced in:
  Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
  Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks. arXiv: 1603.05027, 2016

We can obtain different ResNet variants by changing the network depth, width,
and form of residual unit. This module implements the infrastructure for
building them. Concrete ResNet units and full ResNet networks are implemented in
the accompanying resnet_v1.py and resnet_v2.py modules.

Compared to https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks, in the current
implementation we subsample the output activations in the last residual unit of
each block, instead of subsampling the input activations in the first residual
unit of each block. The two implementations give identical results but our
implementation is more memory efficient.
